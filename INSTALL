INSTALLATION
============

Before installing fetch, the HTTP Fetcher library must be installed.
It can be downloaded from http://cs.nmu.edu/~lhanson/http_fetcher/
-------------------

From the main fetch directory, type:
	
	1) ./configure
	2) make
		then, as root...
	3) make install

That's it.  The program should then be located in /usr/local/bin/ (unless you 
specified a different prefix).

If you don't have root on the machine, you can install the package in your
home directory.  For step 1, do "./configure --prefix=YOUR_PATH" where
YOUR_PATH is the directory under which you'd like to install the package.

To uninstall (from the main fetch distribution directory), type
	make uninstall
